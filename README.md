### Getting started

To start Vue.js run next commands in _bash_ from
the directory of the project:
``` bash
# go to directory with Vue.js
cd front-end

# install all dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
# (or another host, just check the terminal logs at startup)
npm run dev
```
<br />
Something new will be here as soon as possible...
